                    The Reebok Pump is a line of athletic shoes that was first released on 24 November 1989 by Reebok.
                    It
                    was the first shoe to have an internal inflation mechanism that regulated a unique fitting cushion
                    in
                    the lower and upper tongue to provide locking around the ankle.

                    In 1988, Design Continuum, an industrial design firm, partnered with Reebok to design a shoe that
                    used
                    inflatable chambers that pump-up for a custom fit, the Reebok Pump. A demo version of the Pump, a
                    customizable inflatable/deflatable high-top shoe, was exhibited at the Sporting Goods Manufacturers'
                    Association in February 1989.On 24 November 1989, the first Reebok Pump was released. That month,
                    Dominique Wilkins was featured on a television commercial introducing the Reebok Pump. Reebok
